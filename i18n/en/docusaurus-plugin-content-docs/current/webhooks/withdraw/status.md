## How to Use

Although the most efficient way to track withdrawals is by receiving **Webhooks**, this query route is an indispensable read endpoint for maintaining your system.

### Common Use Cases

You will primarily use this endpoint in the following situations:

1. **Reconciliation and Auditing:** Confirm if the amount (`amount`), network data (`blockchainNetwork`), or receiver (`document`/`wallet`) of a withdrawal performed in XGate exactly matches what is in your internal database.
2. **Failure Recovery (Fallback):** If your server goes offline and you miss receiving a Webhook, you can create a routine (CRON) that queries "Pending" withdrawals using this endpoint to update the lost statuses.
3. **Customer Support (CS):** Fetch data of a specific withdrawal in real-time to help an end customer who is questioning the progress of a withdrawal or the network fee amount (`gasFeeAmount`).

### Practical Example

The primary purpose is to verify the transaction progress. When querying the endpoint, you will focus on the `status` field corresponding to the operation to determine what to show your end customer.

**Verifying settlement:**

In the code below, the system validates if the response has the `currency` (Fiat) or `cryptocurrency` (Crypto) object to extract the correct transaction status:

## Integration

Below is a simple example of how to implement this query using Node.js.

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Node.js">
    The integration example uses the `Axios` library to perform the HTTP request.

    **Installing `Axios`:**
    ```bash
    npm install axios
    ```

    **Javascript Example:**
    ```javascript
    const axios = require("axios");

    (async () => {
        const email = "email@domain.com";
        const password = "••••••";
        const transactionId = "6996170*******************";

        try {
            const url_api = "https://api.xgateglobal.com";
            
            // 1. Get authentication token
            const login = await axios.post(`${url_api}/auth/token`, { email, password });
            
            // 2. Consult withdrawal details
            const { data } = await axios.get(`${url_api}/withdraw/${transactionId}/details`, {
                headers: {
                    "Authorization": `Bearer ${login.data.token}`
                }
            });
            
            console.log("Withdrawal Details:", data);
            
            // Dynamic example of using the response (Fiat or Crypto):
            const operation = data.currency || data.cryptocurrency;
            
            if (operation && operation.status === "PAID") {
                const destination = data.document || data.cryptocurrency.wallet;
                console.log(`The withdrawal was successfully paid to the destination: ${destination}`);
            } else {
                console.log("Transaction status:", operation ? operation.status : "Unknown");
            }

        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Query error:", error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
        }
    })();
